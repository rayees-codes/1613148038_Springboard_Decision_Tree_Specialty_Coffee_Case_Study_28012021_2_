    "# The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you've just finished the Springboard Data Science Career Track course, and have been hired by a rising popular specialty coffee company - RR Diner Coffee - as a data scientist. Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "RR Diner Coffee sells two types of thing:\n",
    "- specialty coffee beans, in bulk (by the kilogram only) \n",
    "- coffee equipment and merchandise (grinders, brewing equipment, mugs, books, t-shirts).\n",
    "\n",
    "RR Diner Coffee has three stores, two in Europe and one in the USA. The flagshap store is in the USA, and everything is quality assessed there, before being shipped out. Customers further away from the USA flagship store have higher shipping charges. \n",
    "\n",
    "You've been taken on at RR Diner Coffee because the company are turning towards using data science and machine learning to systematically make decisions about which coffee farmers they should strike deals with. \n",
    "\n",
    "RR Diner Coffee typically buys coffee from farmers, processes it on site, brings it back to the USA, roasts it, packages it, markets it, and ships it (only in bulk, and after quality assurance) to customers internationally. These customers all own coffee shops in major cities like New York, Paris, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Berlin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, RR Diner Coffee has a decision about whether to strike a deal with a legendary coffee farm (known as the **Hidden Farm**) in rural China: there are rumours their coffee tastes of lychee and dark chocolate, while also being as sweet as apple juice. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a risky decision, as the deal will be expensive, and the coffee might not be bought by customers. The stakes are high: times are tough, stocks are low, farmers are reverting to old deals with the larger enterprises and the publicity of selling *Hidden Farm* coffee could save the RR Diner Coffee business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your first job, then, is ***to build a decision tree to predict how many units of the Hidden Farm Chinese coffee will be purchased by RR Diner Coffee's most loyal customers.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, you and your team have conducted a survey of 710 of the most loyal RR Diner Coffee customers, collecting data on the customers':\n",
    "- age\n",
    "- gender \n",
    "- salary \n",
    "- whether they have bought at least one RR Diner Coffee product online\n",
    "- their distance from the flagship store in the USA (standardized to a number between 0 and 11) \n",
    "- how much they spent on RR Diner Coffee products on the week of the survey \n",
    "- how much they spent on RR Diner Coffee products in the month preeding the survey\n",
    "- the number of RR Diner coffee bean shipments each customer has ordered over the preceding year. \n",
    "\n",
    "You also asked each customer participating in the survey whether they would buy the Hidden Farm coffee, and some (but not all) of the customers gave responses to that question. \n",
    "\n",
    "You sit back and think: if more than 70% of the interviewed customers are likely to buy the Hidden Farm coffee, you will strike the deal with the local Hidden Farm farmers and sell the coffee. Otherwise, you won't strike the deal and the Hidden Farm coffee will remain in legends only. There's some doubt in your mind about whether 70% is a reasonable threshold, but it'll do for the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, then, you will build a decision tree to implement a classification solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Remember how you thought at the start: if more than 70% of the interviewed customers are likely to buy the Hidden Farm coffee, you will strike the deal with the local Hidden Farm farmers and sell the coffee. Otherwise, you won't strike the deal and the Hidden Farm coffee will remain in legends only. Well now's crunch time. Are you going to go ahead with that idea? If so, you won't be striking the deal with the Chinese farmers. \n",
    "\n",
    "They're called `decision trees`, aren't they? So where's the decision? What should you do? (Cue existential cat emoji). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, though, we can't write an algorithm to actually *make the business decision* for us. This is because such decisions depend on our values, what risks we are willing to take, the stakes of our decisions, and how important it us for us to *know* that we will succeed. What are you going to do with the models you've made? Are you going to risk everything, strike the deal with the *Hidden Farm* farmers, and sell the coffee? \n",
    "\n",
    "The philosopher of language Jason Stanley once wrote that the number of doubts our evidence has to rule out in order for us to know a given proposition depends on our stakes: the higher our stakes, the more doubts our evidence has to rule out, and therefore the harder it is for us to know things. We can end up paralyzed in predicaments; sometimes, we can act to better our situation only if we already know certain things, which we can only if our stakes were lower and we'd *already* bettered our situation. \n",

    "## 5. Random Forest\n",
    "You might have noticed an important fact about decision trees. Each time we run a given decision tree algorithm to make a prediction (such as whether customers will buy the Hidden Farm coffee) we will actually get a slightly different result. This might seem weird, but it has a simple explanation: machine learning algorithms are by definition ***stochastic***, in that their output is at least partly determined by randomness. \n",
    "\n",
    "To account for this variability and ensure that we get the most accurate prediction, we might want to actually make lots of decision trees, and get a value that captures the centre or average of the outputs of those trees. Luckily, there's a method for this, known as the ***Random Forest***. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, Random Forest involves making lots of trees with similar properties, and then performing summary statistics on the outputs of those trees to reach that central value. Random forests are hugely powerful classifers, and they can improve predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why not try to inform your decision with random forest? You'll need to make use of the RandomForestClassifier function within the sklearn.ensemble module, found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). "
